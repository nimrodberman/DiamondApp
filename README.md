# DiamondApp
A web app that helps diamond brokers search quickly and simply data about a certain diamond in thier data sources.

Many diamonds brokers have thier own information about how much they should pay for a certian diamonds.
The price is conclouded by factors like shape, color, cut and more... and each broker have his own prefrences and threreby different price he willing to pay.
The multitude of the factors make it diffcult to search the price for each diamond. And so here we come to help! 

# The Code Project
the project consist:
1. diamonds database - using sql the broker can upload his data into the app. 
2. Webapp - using flask, a light wight server service, we provide the broker an acceses to the data base throgh a simple web app.
   there are 2 main feutures in the app: 
   a. Search manually the diamond price by running a quick query. I used simple SqlLite3 database.
   b. Search by taking the diamond certificate picture and recive the diamond price - on this feature i will elaborte later.
